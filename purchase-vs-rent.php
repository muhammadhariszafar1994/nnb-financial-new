                                        Building Equity: As you make mortgage payments, you build equity in your home. Equity is

                                        difference between the property’s market value and the outstanding loan amount. Building
                                        equity can provide financial stability and serve as an asset that can be leveraged in

                                        Potential Appreciation: Over time, real estate has the potential to appreciate in value.
                                        While it’s not guaranteed, historically, properties have tended to increase in value. If
                                        your home appreciates, you can benefit from the increase in equity and potentially make
                                        a profit when you sell it in the future.

                                        Potential Rental Income: If you have extra space in your home, such as a basement or an
                                        additional unit, you may have the opportunity to generate rental income by becoming a

                                        income to help offset your mortgage costs.

                                        Building Equity: As you make mortgage payments, you build equity in your home. Equity is
                                        the
                                        difference between the property’s market value and the outstanding loan amount. Building
                                        equity can provide financial stability and serve as an asset that can be leveraged in

                                        Potential Appreciation: Over time, real estate has the potential to appreciate in value.
                                        While it’s not guaranteed, historically, properties have tended to increase in value. If
                                        your home appreciates, you can benefit from the increase in equity and potentially make

                                        Potential Rental Income: If you have extra space in your home, such as a basement or an
                                        additional unit, you may have the opportunity to generate rental income by becoming a

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in">
                            When Purchase vs Rent, it’s important to consider the various costs associated with the
                            purchase. Here are some common costs to keep in mind:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="assoc--list">
                            <li data-aos="zoom-in">

                                    Down Payment: The down payment is a percentage of the purchase price that you pay
                                    upfront. The amount will vary depending on the type of mortgage loan and the
                                    lender’s requirements. Conventional loans often require a down payment between 3%
                                    and 20% of the purchase price, while some government-backed loans may have lower
                                    down payment options.
                                </p>

                                    Closing Costs: These are fees associated with the closing of the real estate
                                    transaction. Closing costs typically include fees for services such as the
                                    appraisal, home inspection, title search, title insurance, attorney fees, lender
                                    fees, and recording fees. The total closing costs can range from 2% to 5% of the
                                    purchase price of the home.
                                </p>

                                    Mortgage Insurance: If your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price, you
                                    may be required to pay for mortgage insurance. This insurance protects the lender in
                                    case you default on the loan. The cost of mortgage insurance will depend on the loan
                                    type and the loan-to-value ratio.
                                </p>

                                    Property Taxes: As a homeowner, you will be responsible for paying property taxes to
                                    your local government. The amount of property taxes will vary based on the assessed
                                    value of the property and the tax rates in your area. Property taxes are typically
                                    paid annually or divided into monthly payments and included in your mortgage payment
                                    through an escrow account.
                                </p>

                                    Homeowners Insurance: Lenders typically require homeowners insurance to protect the
                                    property in case of damage or loss. The cost of homeowners insurance will depend on
                                    factors such as the location, size, and value of the home, as well as the coverage
                                    options you choose.

                                    Homeowners Association (HOA) Fees: If you are buying a property in a community
                                    governed by a homeowners association, you may need to pay HOA fees. These fees cover
                                    the costs of maintaining common areas, amenities, and community services.

                                    Moving Costs: Moving from your current residence to the new home will involve
                                    expenses such as hiring a moving company, renting a truck, or purchasing packing
                                    supplies.

                            Consulting with NNB Financial and obtaining a Loan Estimate from your lender can help you

                            Calculate your debt-to-income ratio: Your debt-to-income ratio compares your monthly debt
                            payments to your monthly income. Lenders typically prefer a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or
                            lower. Calculate your ratio by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross
                            monthly income. This will help you determine how much you can afford to allocate towards a
                            mortgage payment.

                            Consider your down payment: Determine how much you can save for a down payment. A larger
                            down payment will lower your mortgage amount and potentially result in better loan terms.
                            Evaluate your savings and decide on a down payment amount that aligns with your financial
                            goals.

                            pre-approved for a mortgage. This involves providing your financial information and
                            receiving a conditional approval based on your creditworthiness and financial situation. The
